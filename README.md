# TODO
Advanced TODO list program for use in the terminal.

### TODO:
- [ ] Make basic TODO list in a `.td` file or something
- [ ] Make it so `.td` files can be 'synced' to markdown
- [ ] Make 'global' TODO files that are in appdata or something
- [ ] Make a fancy website preview
- [ ] Color themes and different styles. Maybe welcome message
- [ ] Proper documentation
- [ ] Extract TODO comments from code files and put in list
- [ ] Support for multiple TODO lists in the same directory


# Documentation
Documentation for how to use the cli thingy. Btw, if you don't know how to read docs, anything in those fancy html brackets gets replaced with what ever is inside them. So something like `My name is <name>!` would be like `My name is bob!` trust !!

## Create a new TODO list
A todo list is any file that ends with `.td`. When you run the command
```cmd
todo
```
and make an edit such as adding a name, or item, the file will automatically be created for further use.

## View, and edit a TODO list
